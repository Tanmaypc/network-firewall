input - 
The script is designed to intercept and process network packets in real-time.
Therefore, you need network traffic on the machine where the script is running. 
This could be achieved by sending/receiving packets to/from the machine, or by running 
the script on a network gateway or router.

Expected Output:
IPs, Ports, and Prefixes:
If a packet's source IP, destination port, or source IP prefix matches the defined banned lists
in the JSON configuration, the script will print a message indicating that the packet is blocked.

Ping Attacks:
If the script is configured to block ICMP (ping) attacks (BlockPingAttacks set to True),
it will enforce a threshold for the number of pings allowed from a source IP within 
a specified time frame (TimeThreshold and PacketThreshold in the JSON configuration). 
If this threshold is exceeded, the script will print a message and drop the packet.

Console Output:
The script will print messages to the console indicating the actions taken for each packet, 
such as whether it was accepted or dropped.
